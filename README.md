# VB Music Player
This is a music player project I made for a college assigment in `2025`

# Instructions:
Please make sure not to modify the core folders, as it wil mess with the whole coding.

# First Set Up:
Check your node and npm version with: 
```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
```
My versions are respectively: `v22.14.0` & `v10.9.2`
- Please, open your local terminal on VSCode and write the following: `npm install`, since this project is ignoring the node_modules folder.
- When it is done, make sure to execute electron `npm run start` inside the MP-APP directory, sometimes the terminal might change and execute in the main folder instead of the MP-APP folder. Just write:
```bash
  cd MP-APP
```
Obs.: If you are already inside this folder, just execute normally.
# Songs:
When pressing the "Open Folder" button, the songs will not show up due to windows security, but the app still can access them. Just click "Ok" or "Open" and that's it.
